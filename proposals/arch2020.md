# Architecture for Selection and Authentication

This is a draft for discussion. Questions? Ian Jacobs or Adrian Hope-Bailie.

## Introduction

One design goal of Payment Request API is to streamline checkout by making it easy for users to reuse stored payment credentials.

In the past year the Web Payments Working Group has also turned its attention to the smooth integration of strong customer authentication (SCA) into Payment Request, notably using Web Authentication.

The current document intends to support discussion of a flexible architecture that enables browsers to support a variety of use cases.

## Capabilities

* Modal windows
  * Display origin of content
  * 1p storage access in a payment context
  * Can be created by merchant or payment app
* Payment Method Selection
  * Filtering and sorting of instruments based on what payment methods the merchant accepts
  * Skip the sheet is a valuable addition to streamline selection
* Browser credential selector
  * Assumes credentials can be registered (by payment app, relying party, merchant, etc.)
  * May be further streamlined by "default instrument" settings in the browser
* Streamlined authentication
  * This is a goal of SPC

## Use Cases

These features might be used as following in different use cases:


|                     | Merchant modal | Payment app modal | Payment Method Selection | Browser credential selector | Streamlined authentication | 
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----|-----|
| *Pay (one PMI)      |                |         Yes         |      (skip the sheet) |     |    | 
| Multiple PMIs       |                |         Yes         |              Yes    |          |     |
| Form fill + 3DS     |      Yes (OTP)   |                   |              |               |  Yes  |
| SRC via payment app |                |         Yes         |  (skip the sheet) |               |  Maybe   | 
| SRC via browser     |      Yes         |                   |      Maybe (depends on design)   |     Yes              |  Yes  |
