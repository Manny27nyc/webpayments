# Architecture for Selection and Authentication

This is a draft for discussion. Questions? Ian Jacobs or Adrian Hope-Bailie.

## Introduction

One design goal of Payment Request API is to streamline checkout by making it easy for users to reuse stored payment credentials.

In the past year the Web Payments Working Group has also turned its attention to the smooth integration of strong customer authentication (SCA) into Payment Request, notably using Web Authentication.

The current document intends to support discussion of a flexible architecture that enables browsers to support a variety of use cases.

## Use cases

The following table describes use cases where we envision Payment Request can enhance the user experience.

        |Merchant|Browser|Payment App
--------|--------|-------|-----------
Selection only||Integrated card-on-file with other credentials|Mobile Wallets
--------|--------|-------|-----------
Authentication only|Basic card + SPC. SRC|Out-of-band authentication|Out-of-band authentication
