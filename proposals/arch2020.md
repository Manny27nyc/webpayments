# Architecture for Selection and Authentication

This is a draft for discussion. Questions? Ian Jacobs or Adrian Hope-Bailie.

## Introduction

One design goal of Payment Request API is to streamline checkout by making it easy for users to reuse stored payment credentials.

In the past year the Web Payments Working Group has also turned its attention to the smooth integration of strong customer authentication (SCA) into Payment Request, notably using Web Authentication.

The current document intends to support discussion of a flexible architecture that enables browsers to support a variety of use cases.

## Use cases

The following table describes use cases where we envision Payment
Request can enhance the user experience.

|                     | Merchant-stored | Browser-stored | Payment App-stored      |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Selection only      | Merge with browser-stored | Basic Card. Guest checkout | Hand over control      |
| Authentication Only | Basic card using SPC | None | Hand over control |
| Both                | Merge with browser-stored using SPC | Stored info using SPC | Hand over control |

## Capabilities

* Payment credential storage (to reduce re-typing and represent a trust signal to the browser)
* Modal window (as opposed to redirect) with 1p storage access.
* Filtering and sorting of instruments based on what payment methods the merchant accepts
* Reducing total number of user gestures when both selecting and authenticating.
* Reducing need to open windows by offloading functionality to the browser (e.g., through SPC)

Those might be used as following in different use cases:


|                     | Merchant modal | Payment app modal | Browser credential selector | SPC | 
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----|
| *Pay                |                |         X         |                             |     |
| Form fill + 3DS     |      X         |                   |                             |  X  |
| SRC via payment app |                |         X         |                             |     | 
| SRC via browser     |      X         |                   |              X              |  X  |
| Multiple PMIs       |                |         X         |              X              |     |
